# AI4REALNET Augmented Decision-Making HMI

This HMI is developed for augmented human decision making, considering two interaction types: 
1. **Human-AI Co-Learning:** The co-learning interaction mode aims to achieve mutually beneficial interaction between the human and AI agent. 
    - Human Learning:
        1. Hypothesis Evaluation: the human is able to formulate hypotheses about the environment, for which the AI agent searches for evidence for and against.
        2. Solution Suggestion by AI Agent: triggered either by an event or human request, the AI agent provides solutions to problems.
        3. Human Solution Evaluation: the human agent can provide a solution to the AI agent, which is then evaluated by means of simulation. The human receives both the simulation and a statistical description. 
2. **Autonomous AI:** In the autonomous interaction mode, the human agent acts as a director, providing high-level directives through the HMI to the AI agent, which then executes the directive autonomously.
